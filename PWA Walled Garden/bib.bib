abstract = {Many cyberattacks start with disseminating phishing URLs. When clicking these phishing URLs, the victim's private information is leaked to the attacker. There have been proposed several machine learning methods to detect phishing URLs. However, it still remains under-explored to detect phishing URLs with evasion, i.e., phishing URLs that pretend to be benign by manipulating patterns. In many cases, the attacker i) reuses prepared phishing web pages because making a completely brand-new set costs non-trivial expenses, ii) prefers hosting companies that do not require private information and are cheaper than others, iii) prefers shared hosting for cost efficiency, and iv) sometimes uses benign domains, IP addresses, and URL string patterns to evade existing detection methods. Inspired by those behavioral characteristics, we present a network-based inference method to accurately detect phishing URLs camouflaged with legitimate patterns, i.e., robust to evasion. In the network approach, a phishing URL will be still identified as phishy even after evasion unless a majority of its neighbors in the network are evaded at the same time. Our method consistently shows better detection performance throughout various experimental tests than state-of-the-art methods, e.g., F-1 of 0.891 for our method vs. 0.840 for the best feature-based method.},

abstract = {Although malicious software (malware) has been around since the early days of computers, the sophistication and innovation of malware has increased over the years. In particular, the latest crop of ransomware has drawn attention to the dangers of malicious software, which can cause harm to private users as well as corporations, public services (hospitals and transportation systems), governments, and security institutions. To protect these institutions and the public from malware attacks, malicious activity must be detected as early as possible, preferably before it conducts its harmful acts. However, it is not always easy to know what to look forâ€”especially when dealing with new and unknown malware that has never been seen. Analyzing a suspicious file by static or dynamic analysis methods can provide relevant and valuable information regarding a file's impact on the hosting system and help determine whether the file is malicious or not, based on the method's predefined rules. While various techniques (e.g., code obfuscation, dynamic code loading, encryption, and packing) can be used by malware writers to evade static analysis (including signature-based anti-virus tools), dynamic analysis is robust to these techniques and can provide greater understanding regarding the analyzed file and consequently can lead to better detection capabilities. Although dynamic analysis is more robust than static analysis, existing dynamic analysis tools and techniques are imperfect, and there is no single tool that can cover all aspects of malware behavior. The most recent comprehensive survey performed in this area was published in 2012. Since that time, the computing environment has changed dramatically with new types of malware (ransomware, cryptominers), new analysis methods (volatile memory forensics, side-channel analysis), new computing environments (cloud computing, IoT devices), new machine-learning algorithms, and more. The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of existing methods used to dynamically analyze malware, which includes a description of each method, its strengths and weaknesses, and its resilience against malware evasion techniques. In addition, we include an overview of prominent studies presenting the usage of machine-learning methods to enhance dynamic malware analysis capabilities aimed at detection, classification, and categorization.},

abstract = {This paper describes EM-Based Detection of Deviations in Program Execution (EDDIE), a new method for detecting anomalies in program execution, such as malware and other code injections, without introducing any overheads, adding any hardware support, changing any software, or using any resources on the monitored system itself. Monitoring with EDDIE involves receiving electromagnetic (EM) emanations that are emitted as a side effect of execution on the monitored system, and it relies on spikes in the EM spectrum that are produced as a result of periodic (e.g. loop) activity in the monitored execution. During training, EDDIE characterizes normal execution behavior in terms of peaks in the EM spectrum that are observed at various points in the program execution, but it does not need any characterization of the malware or other code that might later be injected. During monitoring, EDDIE identifies peaks in the observed EM spectrum, and compares these peaks to those learned during training. Since EDDIE requires no resources on the monitored machine and no changes to the monitored software, it is especially well suited for security monitoring of embedded and IoT devices. We evaluate EDDIE on a real IoT system and in a cycle-accurate simulator, and find that even relatively brief injected bursts of activity (a few milliseconds) are detected by EDDIE with high accuracy, and that it also accurately detects when even a few instructions are injected into an existing loop within the application.},

abstract = {Direct Anonymous Attestation (Daa) is a set of cryptographic schemes used to create anonymous digital signatures. To provide additional assurance, Daa schemes can utilise a Trusted Platform Module (Tpm) that is a tamper-resistant hardware device embedded in a computing platform and which provides cryptographic primitives and secure storage. We extend Chen and Li's Daa scheme to support: 1) signing a message anonymously, 2) self-certifying Tpm keys, and 3) ascertaining a platform's state as recorded by the Tpm's platform configuration registers (PCR) for remote attestation, with explicit reference to Tpm2.0 API calls. We perform a formal analysis of the scheme and are the first symbolic models to explicitly include the low-level Tpm call details. Our analysis reveals that a fix pro-posed by Whitefield et al. to address an authentication attack on an Ecc-Daa scheme is also required by our scheme. Developing a fine-grained, formal model of a Daa scheme contributes to the growing body of work demonstrating the use of formal tools in supporting security analyses of cryptographic protocols. We additionally provide and benchmark an open-source C++implementation of this Daa scheme supporting both a hardware and a software Tpm and measure its performance.},

abstract = {Apple iOS is one of the most popular mobile operating systems. As its core security technology, iOS provides application sandboxing but assigns a generic sandboxing profile to every third-party application. However, recent attacks and incidents with benign applications demonstrate that this design decision is vulnerable to crucial privacy and security breaches, allowing applications (either benign or malicious) to access contacts, photos, and device IDs. Moreover, the dynamic character of iOS apps written in Objective-C renders the currently proposed static analysis tools less useful.In this paper, we aim to address the open problem of preventing (not only detecting) privacy leaks and simultaneously strengthening security against runtime attacks on iOS. Compared to similar research work on the open Android, realizing such a system for the closed-source iOS is highly involved.We present the design and implementation of PSiOS, a tool that features a novel policy enforcement framework for iOS. It provides fine-grained, application-specific, and user/administrator defined sandboxing for each third-party application without requiring access to the application source code. Our reference implementation deploys control-flow integrity based on the recently proposed MoCFI (Mobile CFI) framework that only protects applications against runtime attacks. We evaluated several popular iOS applications (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp) to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PSiOS.},

abstract = {Rust is a young programming language designed for systems software development. It aims to provide safety guarantees like high-level languages and performance efficiency like low-level languages. The core design of Rust is a set of strict safety rules enforced by compile-time checking. To support more low-level controls, Rust allows programmers to bypass these compiler checks to write unsafe code.   It is important to understand what safety issues exist in real Rust programs and how Rust safety mechanisms impact programming practices. We performed the first empirical study of Rust by close, manual inspection of 850 unsafe code usages and 170 bugs in five open-source Rust projects, five widely-used Rust libraries, two online security databases, and the Rust standard library. Our study answers three important questions: how and why do programmers write unsafe code, what memory-safety issues real Rust programs have, and what concurrency bugs Rust programmers make. Our study reveals interesting real-world Rust program behaviors and new issues Rust programmers make. Based on our study results, we propose several directions of building Rust bug detectors and built two static bug detectors, both of which revealed previously unknown bugs.},

abstract = {All major web browsers now support WebAssembly, a low-level bytecode intended to serve as a compilation target for code written in languages like C and C++. A key goal of WebAssembly is performance parity with native code; previous work reports near parity, with many applications compiled to WebAssembly running on average 10\% slower than native code. However, this evaluation was limited to a suite of scientific kernels, each consisting of roughly 100 lines of code. Running more substantial applications was not possible because compiling code to WebAssembly is only part of the puzzle: standard Unix APIs are not available in the web browser environment. To address this challenge, we build BROWSIX-WASM, a significant extension to BROWSIX [29] that, for the first time, makes it possible to run unmodified WebAssembly-compiled Unix applications directly inside the browser. We then use BROWSIX-WASM to conduct the first large-scale evaluation of the performance of WebAssembly vs. native. Across the SPEC CPU suite of benchmarks, we find a substantial performance gap: applications compiled to WebAssembly run slower by an average of 45\% (Firefox) to 55\% (Chrome), with peak slowdowns of 2:08\texttimes{} (Firefox) and 2:5\texttimes{} (Chrome). We identify the causes of this performance degradation, some of which are due to missing optimizations and code generation issues, while others are inherent to the WebAssembly platform.},

abstract = {Many users of web search engines have been complaining in recent years about the supposedly decreasing quality of search results. This is often attributed to an increasing amount of search-engine-optimized but low-quality content. Evidence for this has always been anecdotal, yet itâ€™s not unreasonable to think that popular online marketing strategies such as affiliate marketing incentivize the mass production of such content to maximize clicks. Since neither this complaint nor affiliate marketing as such have received much attention from the IR community, we hereby lay the groundwork by conducting an in-depth exploratory study of how affiliate content affects todayâ€™s search engines. We monitored Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo for a year on 7,392&nbsp;product review queries. Our findings suggest that all search engines have significant problems with highly optimized (affiliate) contentâ€”more than is representative for the entire web according to a baseline retrieval system on the ClueWeb22. Focussing on the product review genre, we find that only a small portion of product reviews on the web uses affiliate marketing, but the majority of all search results do. Of all affiliate networks, Amazon Associates is by far the most popular. We further observe an inverse relationship between affiliate marketing use and content complexity, and that all search engines fall victim to large-scale affiliate link spam campaigns. However, we also notice that the line between benign content and spam in the form of content and link farms becomes increasingly blurryâ€”a situation that will surely worsen in the wake of generative&nbsp;AI. We conclude that dynamic adversarial spam in the form of low-quality, mass-produced commercial content deserves more attention. (Code and data: ).},
