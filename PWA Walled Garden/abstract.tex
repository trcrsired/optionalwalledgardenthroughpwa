Traditionally, desktop operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux have allowed sideloading of applications and lacked app sandboxing, resulting in numerous security vulnerabilities, especially for non-tech-savvy users. In contrast, mobile platforms like Android and iOS employ app sandboxing and typically require apps to be installed through official app stores. However, these mobile platforms are often criticized for being overly restrictive, creating \textit{walled garden} ecosystems. Despite these restrictions, many security threats, such as phishing websites, still persist. Furthermore, power users find these environments frustrating due to their inability to customize or operate outside the constraints imposed by the ecosystem.

With the emergence of Progressive Web Apps, this paper explores a novel security model called the S/P Login Toggle. This approach aims to segregate the use cases for power users and average users by leveraging the flexibility and security of PWAs. The paper provides a historical overview, compares the S/P Login Toggle with the security models of existing operating systems, and demonstrates its superiority in balancing usability and security for a diverse range of users.
