\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

S/P mode, akin to the \texttt{unsafe} keyword in programming languages like C\# and Rust, is a straightforward yet highly effective concept. By leveraging progressive web applications and browser sandboxing, implementing an S/P mode toggle has the potential to mitigate most security risks associated with untrusted inputs. For non-technical users, a simple \texttt{walled garden} approach is essential to shield them from the inherent dangers of the internet.

\section{Future Work}
While S/P mode provides a protective \texttt{walled garden} for web browsers—currently the primary source of untrusted inputs—other vulnerabilities, such as malicious emails or SMS messages, may still bypass this safeguard. Extending the principles of S/P mode to address these challenges represents a promising direction for future research.
